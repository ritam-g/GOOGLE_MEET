# WebRTC Test Client — Phase 6

> **Diagnostic tool. Not a deployable. Not a microservice.**  
> Lives outside `/services`. Has no `package.json`, no `Dockerfile`, no docker-compose entry.

---

## Purpose

Proves that the Signaling Service built in Phase 5 can carry a **real RTCPeerConnection handshake** (real SDP offer/answer + real ICE candidates) all the way to live audio/video between two browser tabs.

Phase 5 tests proved **event delivery** (offer/answer/ice-candidate relay works). This file proves **WebRTC correctness** (a real handshake built on top of that relay actually establishes a media stream).

---

## How to Run

### Step 1 — Prerequisites

Make sure all services are running:

```bash
# From the project root
docker-compose up -d
```

Services needed:
| Service | Port | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Auth Service | 4001 | Get access tokens |
| Room Service | 4003 | Create/validate rooms |
| Signaling Service | **4004** | WebSocket signaling |
| Redis | 6379 | Room membership tracking |

### Step 2 — Serve the test client

> `file://` URLs block `getUserMedia()` in most browsers (HTTPS/localhost requirement).  
> Always serve this via a local HTTP server.

```bash
cd test-client
npx serve .
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** (or whatever port `serve` prints).

### Step 3 — Get credentials

Use Postman or curl to:

1. **Sign up / log in** two different users → get `accessToken` for each
2. **Create a room** with one user → get `roomCode`

```bash
# Example: create a room
POST http://localhost:4000/v1/rooms
Authorization: Bearer <User A's token>
Content-Type: application/json
{"name": "test-room"}
```

### Step 4 — Two tabs

| Tab | Token | Room Code |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| Tab 1 | User A's `accessToken` | Same `roomCode` |
| Tab 2 | User B's `accessToken` | Same `roomCode` |

1. Open Tab 1 → paste token + room code → **Join Call** → grant camera/mic
2. Open Tab 2 → paste token + room code → **Join Call** → grant camera/mic

Within a few seconds, both video tiles should show the other tab's camera feed.

## Known Failure Modes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No camera prompt | `file://` blocks `getUserMedia()` | Serve via `npx serve .` |
| `connect_error` in console | Invalid token or Signaling not running | Check token, check `docker ps` |
| `peer-joined` never fires | Wrong room code in one tab | Verify both tabs use identical `roomCode` |
| `setRemoteDescription` throws | SDP mangled in relay | Check relay.ts isn't double-serialising payload |
| ICE flows but video never appears | `ontrack` didn't fire | Confirm `addTrack()` happens before `createOffer()` |
| Works on localhost, fails across networks | NAT traversal needed | Expected — this is what Phase 7 (TURN) solves |

---

## What This Proves / What It Doesn't

| ✅ Proved by this phase | ❌ Not tested here |
|---|---|
| Real SDP offer/answer survives relay round-trip | TURN/STUN for restrictive NAT |
| ICE negotiation completes on localhost/LAN | 3+ simultaneous peers (SFU) |
| `ontrack` fires and media renders | Reconnection handling |
| Phase 5 Signaling is genuinely end-to-end correct | React frontend |

---

## After This Phase

If **Test 8 (remote video renders)** passes → move to **Phase 7: TURN/STUN hardening**.  
Keep this file around as a fast sanity-check after any future Signaling Service changes.
